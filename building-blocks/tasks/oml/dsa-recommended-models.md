Data Science Agent works with large language models accessed through Oracle `DBMS_CLOUD_AI` and `DBMS_CLOUD_AI_AGENT` packages. The `DBMS_CLOUD_AI` package, with Select AI, supports the translation of natural language prompts to generate, run, explain SQL statements, and also enables RAG and natural language-based interactions, including chats with LLMs.
This table lists the recommended large language models and the scenarios in which each should be used.

| Provider | Tier | Large Language Model |
| ------------- | ----------- | ---------------------- |
| OpenAI or OCI GenAI | Top | gpt-6-sol |
| OpenAI or OCI GenAI | Cost-effective | gpt-6-luna |
| OCI GenAI | Top | xai.grok-4.7 |
| OCI GenAI | Cost-effective | xai.grok-4.3 |
| Google | Top | gemini-3.8-flash |
| Google | Cost-effective | gemini-3.8-flash |
| Anthropic | Top | claude-opus-5-5 |
| Anthropic | Cost-effective | claude-sonnet-5-5 |

>**Note:** When using OCI Generative AI, use the provider and model identifiers exactly as documented for OCI GenAI. Some model identifiers may include the original model family or vendor name.


Explanation of tiers:

* **Top:** Represents the best state-of-the-art model from a specific provider. This tier is the strongest option in terms of quality, reliability, and precision.
* **Cost-effective:** Represents a good compromise between quality, cost, and speed. These models are typically faster and less expensive. But the trade-off is lower quality and reliability compared to the Top tier.
